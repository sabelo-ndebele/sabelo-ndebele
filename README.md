- 👋 Hi, I’m @sabelo-ndebele
- 👀 I’m interested in the data science field where I'm still yet to select the niche to go into seeing as my background is in Industrial Engineering hence I'm still a novice.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python programming basics with current focus being data structures and objects. I'm also refreshing the experience in the other concepts I've covered that include control structures and datatypes.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects within my level of expertise to grow my experience in the industry while also making invaluable contributions to the mentioned projects.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
